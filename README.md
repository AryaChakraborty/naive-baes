The Department of Justice has launched this easy-to-use platform for the simple and fast retrieval of previously judged cases also helps them provide justice with the help of technological advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence.<br/>

We have acquired quite a bit of accuracy via our technology, but we always trust that human precision is irreplaceable. So weâ€™ve also integrated a recommendation system that gives the user, the liberty to choose, whether to accept the decision or opt for similar references.<br/>

We also allow the user, the judges of numerous courts throughout India,  to provide data to our system to make it better and more efficient for themselves. We realize that the field we are working in is sensitive and prone to errors. So, the users of our application also have the freedom to change their previously submitted judgements in our system.<br/>

We firmly believe that user experience matters the most in this domain of technology.<br/>
Thus, we have kept a simple and user-friendly design and environment. We hope that we will be able to administer justice faster and flawlessly.<br/>
